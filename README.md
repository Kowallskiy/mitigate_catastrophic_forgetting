# Continual Learning Algorithms

Welcome to my repository dedicated to exploring various Continual Learning (CL) algorithms! Continual Learning, also known as lifelong learning, aims to develop machine learning models that can learn from a continuous stream of data, acquiring new knowledge while retaining previously learned information. This field addresses one of the fundamental challenges in AI: catastrophic forgetting, where a model forgets old knowledge as it learns new information.

## Project Overview

In this project, I dive into four distinct algorithms that propose solutions to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in neural networks. Each algorithm approaches the problem from a different angle, offering unique insights and strategies for preserving knowledge across tasks. The primary goal of this work is to implement and understand these algorithms' mechanics, rather than achieving state-of-the-art results. Through hands-on experimentation, I've gained a deeper appreciation of the challenges and potential solutions within the domain of continual learning.

### Algorithms Explored

1. __Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC)__: EWC minimizes catastrophic forgetting by selectively slowing down learning on weights important for previous tasks.

2. __Learning Without Forgetting (L2F)__: This technique focuses on retaining the performance on old tasks when learning new tasks, using knowledge distillation to preserve learned responses.

3. __Synaptic Intelligence (SI)__: SI quantifies the importance of each synapse for past learning tasks and uses this information to protect critical weights from significant changes.

4. __Meta Continual Learning (MCL)__: Leveraging meta-learning principles, MCL enhances a model's ability to quickly adapt to new tasks while minimizing interference with previously acquired knowledge.

### Reflections

While I did not achieve groundbreaking results through these implementations, the journey provided invaluable insights into the complexity of continual learning. The process of implementing these algorithms deepened my understanding of their underlying principles and the trade-offs involved in designing systems capable of lifelong learning. Each algorithm offered a unique perspective on how to balance the acquisition of new knowledge with the retention of old, highlighting the diverse approaches within the field.
